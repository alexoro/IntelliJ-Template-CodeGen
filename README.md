# Template CodeGen
## IntelliJ plugin for creating files from templates

Are you working within some framework where you need to create a lot of boilerplate files?
Is there a need to create templates and reuse them within the team?
Well, this plugin is for you.

## Key features
- Templates are a set of some files inside a project. So you can share it within team.
- Supports placeholder. Wrap placeholder with '##'. I.e. ##I_AM_PLACEHOLDER##.
- Placeholders are supported in: directory names, file names and file contents.

## How to use
- Install plugin from plugin marketplace.
- Specify templates directory in plugin settings: 'Preferences' -> 'Tools' -> 'Template CodeGen'.
- Create templates in specified folder. Each folder is a separate template.
- Make a 'right button click' on a directory you want to place templates in, select 'New' -> 'Create from Template'.
- Fill the placeholders and press 'OK' :)
